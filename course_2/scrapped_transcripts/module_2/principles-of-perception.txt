We encounter principles of visualization in many real-world situations.
For example, think about a subway or metro map.
Why do they work?
The design of subway maps relies heavily on visualization principles, such as the Gestalt
principle of perception, that we will discuss in this module, to make complex information
visually digestible.
Here is how the Gestalt principles are applied in the creation of this DC metro map.
Stations along the same line are positioned close together, even if they are not exactly
matching the geographical map, as you can view the contrast between the geographical
versus the metro map in this figure.
This helps users perceive them as part of the same route.
Different subway lines are represented by distinct colors, and all the stops along a
line share the same visual style, aiding categorization of a station in one specific
line and visually observing this grouping of the stations.
The lines are simplified into straight or curved paths, allowing viewers to trace routes
smoothly without confusion from geographic distortions.
The map's design emphasizes the subway lines and station names against a minimalistic background,
making it easy to focus on the routes.
