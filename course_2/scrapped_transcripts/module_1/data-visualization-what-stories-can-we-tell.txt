This is an example of stories we can tell with data around us.
We Feel Fine is an artwork project which was created by a computer scientist and an artist
who collected expressions of human emotions on personal blogs for several years.
They identified any posts which included the phrases I feel or I am feeling and saved
that along with any additional information associated with that phrase, such as images
or metadata such as time of the post, location of the post, or weather at the time of the
post.
They were then able to create data visualizations, such as the ones here, to tell a story about
the collective emotions, at different times and different locations.
The first image uses pictures associated with these blog posts to create a collage to tell
a story of how our collective feelings look like.
The second plot shows a cloud of these feelings, with each dot representing one feeling and
the color of the dot representing the sentiment of the feeling, with warmer colors representing
happier and more positive feelings and colder colors representing more negative and sad
feelings.
