Welcome to the course on the art of data visualization.
Data visualization is a storytelling in a graphical medium.
Not only does it communicate the data,
it can evoke emotions through art and creativity.
This course helps you explore the basic principles of data visualization,
including telling a story, making a good sign,
fulfilling a purpose, incorporating human perception,
using color and visual elements,
and selecting the appropriate chart format.
The art of data visualization course will cover
topics and the techniques of creating data visualization,
as well as the art of developing
a compelling and effective data visualization.
We'll look at visualization examples and
work on identifying their strengths and weaknesses.
We'll learn to use Python programming to create different visualizations.
We'll learn how complex data such as
network and time series data can be visualized.
We'll work with maps and interactive visualization,
and we will put all these visualization together to tell
engaging stories with data that can evoke the audience's emotion.
You will gain knowledge to begin developing
a discriminating eye for good visualization,
and learn how to most effectively communicate
information using visual elements.
You'll learn central principles of perception and data organization.
This introductory course assumes
minimal technical background in terms of basic programming.
It provides references to
these limited required prior background knowledge,
making it an ideal course for learners with
limited previous experience in data analysis and data visualization.
If you're interested in creative ways of exploring data,
learning to write computer programs,
and using new tools to explore data visualization,
you'll be successful in this course.
Enjoy the journey through data visualization,
programming, art, and storytelling.
