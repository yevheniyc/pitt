In the next modules we'll examine and use Python for data visualization. We'll
explore how we can use Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to
create simple charts as well as perform advanced visualization and manipulation
of figures. Python libraries are very powerful in enabling us to visualize and
explore data that matters to us. For example we can examine global climate
change through measures such as temperature anomalies over time. We can
get publicly available data at the National Center for Environmental
Information and use a few lines of Python code to visualize national
temperature changes over time. The data set looks like this and these few lines
of code can generate the visualization for us. While this simple example can
easily be visualized in Excel as well, the power of using Python is more
evident when we need to work with large data sets, automate the process of
visualization, and create advanced visualization such as the heat map
shown in the figure.
