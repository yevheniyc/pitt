When analyzing data and creating visualizations, time is often a critical
factor that interacts with various types of data. Visualizing data as a time
series along the time dimension can be incredibly insightful, helping to uncover
patterns, trends, and anomalies. A time series is a sequence of data points
collected over a period typically at regular intervals. Time series
visualizations are especially useful for observing trends and patterns in data
and are widely utilized in everyday applications. For instance, you might
visualize your energy consumption or health metrics as a time series to gain
better insights. One example of such a visualization is a graph of an
individual's pulse data collected over eight years during routine doctor
visits provided by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In this graph,
an unusually high pulse rate is observed in February 2020, which might indicate a
fever or another health issue. Figure 2 illustrates water usage over time, a type
of data frequently provided by utility companies. In this case, the data is
sourced from the Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority. The graph shows the
trend of water usage over one year, highlighting a strong seasonal
variations. For example, water usage nearly doubles in the summer compared to
winter months, likely due to irrigation or gardening activities.
