Network visualization is a powerful analytical tool for understanding various societal phenomena,
including transportation systems, citation networks, health system networks, and even
food.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge utilize network visualization and analysis
to investigate the relationship between chemical flavor compounds in different foods.
Their goal was to test Whiteley-Howe belief that food with compatible flavors are chemically
similar.
In the resulting network visualization, each node represents an ingredient, with its color
indicating the food category and its size reflecting the ingredient's prevalence in
recipes.
Two ingredients are connected if they share a significant number of flavor compounds,
and the thickness of the link denotes the number of shared compounds between them.
For instance, the yellow nodes represent fruits, and you can observe how similar fruits like
cranberry, blueberry, plum, and peach are interconnected.
Similarly, the green nodes represent mushrooms, which are connected to each other but isolated
from other categories.
Larger nodes, such as onion, garlic, egg, and vegetable oil, highlight the provenance
of these ingredients in recipes.
These network visualizations and analysis reveal that cuisines vary significantly in
how they combine ingredients.
For example, in North American cuisine, similar ingredients like milk, egg, butter, cocoa,
and vanilla frequently appear together.
In contrast, East Asian cuisines often combine food with fewer chemical similarities, such
as shrimp, lemon, ginger, soy sauce, and hot peppers.
