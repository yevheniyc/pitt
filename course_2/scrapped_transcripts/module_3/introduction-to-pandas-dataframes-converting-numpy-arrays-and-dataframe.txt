Hello everyone.
In this video, we're going to be working with pandas data frames.
So we will be building off of the material from the previous recording.
As you can see, I already have a Jupyter notebook opened up.
So, again, please pause the video and open up your own if you don't have one already.
Let me go ahead and rename this
week_04_pandas_dataframes_intro.
Put in some header information.
Introduction to pandas dataframes.
The previous video was all
about pandas series.
A series contains values associated with a single variable.
The DataFrame is a collection of variables or
a collection of pandas series.
All right, let's go ahead and import modules.
Pandas is built on top of numpy, so we need numpy and then pandas.
So import numpy as np,
import pandas as pd, and run that cell.
The purpose of this video is to demonstrate how to create pandas
DataFrames, that's what you're going to see how to do.
We will create the DataFrames.
However, a few ways to highlight the fact that data frames can be
viewed several different ways or interpreted several different ways.
The first approach is to go from NumPy to DataFrames.
We've previously learned that pandas series are kind of like 1D NumPy arrays.
Well, one interpretation of a DataFrame is that
a pandas DataFrame is kind of like a 2D NumPy array.
So let's create a data frame from a 2D NumPy array.
We will make a simple 2D array
that I'll name X by reshaping
a 1D array into a 2D array.
Notice I'm using arange to go from 1 up to but excluding 25.
So this will be 24 elements as a 1D array, but
then reshaping to produce 6 rows and the required number of columns.
We have, of course, the shape attribute, 6 rows,
4 columns to confirm, yes, there are two dimensions.
The size, 6 times 4 is 24.
Now, we learned from the previous
week that we can select the zeroth row or
the one row or the last row because,
by default, NumPy is really row centric.
Displaying the 2D array to the screen, the zeroth row,
we get this top row, the one row, we get the row beneath it, the last row.
Again, the very last row, each row in the printout or
really the display kind of looks like a list, if you will.
We know it's not a list, but each row kind of looks like a list.
We also know how to slice all rows from a single column.
So here's the zeroth column.
We could do the same thing with the last column.
We also know how to subset one element,
such as from the zeroth row last column or
the last row zeroth column.
And we also know how to slice multiple rows and multiple columns,
the first three rows and the first two columns.
Okay, so this is a little review of the NumPy 2D array.
Let's convert X into a pandas DataFrame.
We will name the variable xdf.
Df is the common convention for DataFrame, so
anytime we work with a DataFrame, you will often
see me name it or include df somewhere in the name.
To convert x, the NumPy 2D array into the pandas DataFrame,
we will call the pd.DataFrame function.
We give it one argument, x.
If we check the environment, x is a 2D array.
6 by4 xdf is not a 2D array,
it is a DataFrame.
We can, of course, also confirm that with the type function.
