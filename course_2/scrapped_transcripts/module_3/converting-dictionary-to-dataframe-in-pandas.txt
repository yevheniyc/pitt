English
To reinforce that, Let's
now create a DataFrame from another data type,
instead of going from NumPy to DataFrames,
let's now go from a Dictionary to a DataFrame.
Let's see the connection between a Dictionary and
a DataFrame by converting a Dictionary into a DataFrame.
Remember that the Dictionary, Has KEY/VALUE
pairs to define each ITEM.
In most of our previous examples,
the KEY was associated with
a SINGLE valued VALUE, but now,
We will use a MULTI-VALUED or
MULTI-ENTRY VALUE per KEY.
And I'm going to use a baseball example for this, I like baseball.
And so my Dictionary is going to have
the following four Keys, the City,
the Team, the Division, and the League.
Notice I populated the Keys before populating anything else,
using colons to separate them and hitting enter to go to a new line.
Four Keys, City, Team, Division, League.
The Values will be lists, My
first Value will be a list containing the entries Pittsburgh,
Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis,
oops, Louis, and finally Milwaukee.
The next Value will also be a list, again, another list of strings.
Pirates, Reds, Cubs,
Cardinals, Brewers.
Look closely, one, two, three, four, five Values,
one, two, three, four, five Values.
So each element in the lists is associated with a different
major league baseball team, of the city it's located in and the team name.
Now for division, all five teams
are in the Central division and
all five teams are in the National League or NL.
So here I'm using Python to replicate this value five times,
same thing with the league.
Here is the Dictionary itself,
where if I use the key, I can extract out
all five entries in that one Value.
All right, let's now convert the Dictionary into a DataFrame.
I'll name this baseball_df gets assigned pd.dataframe.
But now the argument to pd.dataframe will be the baseball_dict.
Let's display it.
Again we can see the bold face font on the left and
the bold face font at the very top.
There's this kind of dividing line that separates
that topmost header row from all of the other rows.
And I use that term header row very particularly,
you will learn more about that as we continue to go through this example.
But let's again look closely at the layout of our DataFrame.
Do you remember the Key City and the Key Team?
Well, City is the Column Name
associated with all of these values down the row.
Likewise, Team has become the Column Name
associated with these other values that go down the road.
The reason why I like to demonstrate this
conversion from a Dictionary into a DataFrame is
to highlight the Key is what becomes the columns.
The Dictionary Keys become Column Names.
In fact, there's an attribute columns
that gives us the names of every column.
The Column Names,
Are the same as the Dictionary Keys.
Why is that important,
because the Dictionary VALUES become
the entries within the ROWS for each COLUMN.
In the DataFrame the index is really what's
describing what's happening per row and
the columns is what describes per column.
So let's reinforce that by showing the major DataFrame attributes.
The .index attribute,
Is associated with the row, it defines the row,
it's associated with the values similar to a panda
series index, but it is the row in the table.
So here's the index for the xdf versus the index for the baseball df.
The columns, Define or
are associated with, as the name states, the columns in the table.
In xdf the Column Names were integers.
But in baseball df the Column Names were strings.
They were names just like you would think in a table,
in a spreadsheet, they're character strings.
