Now because DataFrames are built on top
of NumPy or pandas is built on top of NumPy,
pandas DataFrames also have the shape attribute.
If you ever want to know the number
of rows and columns in your DataFrame,
you can just use.shape to pull that out.
We already know that
our xdf and baseball_df objects are DataFrames,
but we are really interested in the data type
associated with each column
contained within the DataFrame.
Even though the object itself is a DataFrame,
we are really interested in the dtypes attribute.
The dtypes attribute stores
the data type for every single column.
Xdf only had integers,
so every column is an integer.
Whereas baseball_df, every column were strings.
Now this is something that is confusing.
Pandas does not call strings a string.
Pandas calls string or characters, objects.
This is a little confusing.
It's because pandas likes to pretend,
it's super general and can handle
a whole lot of situations which it can.
But most of the time when you see object for the dtype,
the data type of a column,
most of the time that means you have strings.
Now, if you look closely,
this object that we are extracting
out with the dtypes attribute,
this object itself is actually a series.
The index of that series
is the column names from the DataFrame.
I want to point this out because
oftentimes when we're working with pandas DataFrames,
we will be using attributes and
methods that produce pandas series.
The reason why we've had to first
introduce the pandas series
is because we need to know how to work with the series,
even when we are usually working with DataFrames,
attributes and methods will give
us series coming from the DataFrame.
A quick introduction now to DataFrame methods.
We will only show a few in this video.
Next week is really dedicated to DataFrame methods
so you will not see
a lot of methods in this recording this week.
Methods can be applied to the entire object,
the whole DataFrame,
or to individual columns.
In this recording, we will see
methods applied to the entire DataFrame.
A very important method is the.info method.
It provides summary information
about the entire DataFrame.
It tells you about the index attribute.
The index attribute here is a range index,
there are six rows.
It also tells you about the columns.
It says how many columns there are.
Another way to find out the number of rows and columns
besides shape is info.
You get the names of every single column.
You get the data type for
every single column and you get a summary.
There are four integer data types.
We will discuss what this middle thing of
non null count means more another time.
Let's look at the.info for the baseball DataFrame.
Five rows, four columns.
Here are the names of the columns.
All four of them are objects strings and again,
summary, there are four objects strings.
Another very useful method that is applied to
the entire DataFrame is.describe.
Describe provides descriptive statistics.
We have been working with
a descriptive statistic a lot so far this semester;
the mean or the average.
We have also worked with the standard deviation.
The minimum and the maximum are also
reported and we will discuss
what these other ones are another time.
But what is the mean?
What mean is being shown?
This is the mean for every column.
