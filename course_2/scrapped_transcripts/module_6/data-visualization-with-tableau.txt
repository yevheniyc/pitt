Tableau is a widely used visualization tool that offers great flexibility in analyzing
data and creating visualizations, dashboards, and reports.
Many users choose to publish their visualization and data storage publicly.
According to Tableau's blog, over a million visualizations are published each year.
One example of a Tableau data story explores social media use across the United States
in 2024, broken down by age, gender, income, political affiliation, and race and ethnicity.
The visualization reveals that young people aged 18 to 29 dominate social media usage
and exhibit distinct patterns.
For instance, platforms like TikTok and Snapchat are particularly popular among this age group.
In contrast, individuals over 30 tend to use Facebook more frequently.
Interestingly, YouTube stands out as a platform that is highly popular across nearly all age groups.
However, social media usage is minimal among those aged 65 and older who primarily use
YouTube and Facebook.
Examining gender differences, the data visualization highlights both similarities and differences
in social media usage.
Overall, women tend to use social media more frequently than men.
When looking at specific platforms, men are more likely to use Reddit, while women are
more likely to use Pinterest.
However, both groups show high engagement with YouTube, making it a widely popular platform
across genders.
As we'll explore in this module, this visualization is publicly available on Tableau Public.
This means you can make a copy of it and customize it to suit your needs.
In this module, we'll learn how to use Tableau Public for data visualization, as well as
for creating interactive dashboards and reports similar to the ones shown in this example.
Dashboards and reports provide dynamic, interactive ways to explore data and uncover insights
from large datasets effectively.
