# Project 1: Network Analysis

## Overview

College football network centrality analysis using NetworkX to explore team relationships and connectivity patterns.

## Files

- `Chuba_Yevheniy_Network-Visualization-Notebook.ipynb` - Main network analysis assignment
- `NetworkX_Tutorial_from_Module8.ipynb` - NetworkX tutorial and learning materials
- `Network_Analysis_Answers_Part2.md` - Written analysis comparing Penn State vs Ohio State centrality

## Key Concepts

- **Degree Centrality**: Number of direct connections (games played)
- **Betweenness Centrality**: Teams serving as bridges in the network
- **Network Visualization**: Graph theory applied to sports data
- **Structural Analysis**: Understanding network topology and team positioning

## Analysis Highlights

- College football network with 115 teams
- Comparative analysis of degree vs betweenness centrality
- Penn State: High connectivity (many opponents)
- Ohio State: High structural importance (network bridge)

## Technical Stack

- NetworkX for graph analysis
- Matplotlib for network visualization
- Python for data processing and analysis
