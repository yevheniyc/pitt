Let's visualize the trend versus the input.
To do this, we need to create our own data.
So instead of giving you a data set and then fitting a model and
then talking about it, we're going to go about this in reverse.
I like to see the assumptions of the linear
model by generating our own data.
We will see what the model thinks can happen and
talk about all its assumptions,
before we go about fitting the model.
Let's create a data frame that contains a single
continuous input that I'll call x between -3.5 and 3.5.
Let's assign this result to the data frame.
Df_viz = pd.Dataframe 1:x.
I'll create it from the np.linspace function -3.5 to 3.5 num = 101.
So I'm using the dictionary to define the key x that has the value.
This one D numpy array with 101 evenly spaced values from here to there.
And then it gets converted into a data frame.
Think of this as you downloaded a data set and
here is the input as in your final projects.
But to calculate the trend or the average output,
we need to know the coefficients,
the intercept and slope of the model.
So I'm going to just define these.
I'll first say the intercept is 0 and the slope is 1.
We will change these in a minute but my intercept is 1 and my slope is 1.
Now, to calculate the trend,
I'm just going to create a new column named trend in df_viz,
which is equal to my_intercept + my_slope times the input.
Df_viz now has two columns, the input x and the trend or average response.
And let's now visualize the relationship in Seaborne using a line chart.
So this is the first time we've created a line chart in Seaborne.
And to help it, I want to set the style to be the white grid,
because having the gridlines will help discuss what's going on.
My relplot will be between or will be based on or
using the data in df_viz where x is x and y is trend.
If I just create this figure by default, a scatter plot is made.
That's the default type or kind of relationship plot.
But I don't want to show a scatter, I want to change kind to line.
Now the reason why I wanted to use the white grid when x is 0,
if I scroll up, the line has the trend at 0,
but now go over or increase the input 1 unit.
So go from x equals 0 to x equals 1.
The line is now telling us,
the trend has increased from 0 to 1.
The rise, the change in the output,
the average output divided by the change in the input x 1/1 = 1.
That is the definition of slope.
Slope is how does the vertical axis change
based on 1 unit change of the horizontal axis.
So in our case, how does the trend change as the input changes?
What this means is if I change my slope, if I scroll up and
now change my slope from 1 to 1/3, for
example, and then I recalculate everything.
At first glance, the picture looks the same.
But look closely at the scale or axis on the vertical axis.
It's not covering the same range, start with x equals 0.
The trend is equal to 0.
But now for the trend,
the vertical axis to increase by 1 unit,
my input has to increase 3 units.
The change in the trend divided by
the change in the input is 1/3.
It takes three unit change of the input to cause a 1 unit
change in my trend, or let's just call it output.
So rise over run, that's what the slope tells you.
How many units does the trend change for every 1 unit change of your input?
Let's see this one more time.
But now let's set the slope to 3 instead of 1/3.
Do this again.
Now, when my input changes by 1 unit,
the output changes by more than 1 unit.
It changes by 3 units.
If the input changes 3 units,
now the output changes 9 units because 3 x 3 = 9.
