Hello everyone.
In this video, we will continue exploring data with Pandas,
learning about how to group by and aggregate or split apply combine.
This is a very important and fundamental exploratory data analysis set of skills.
So this is an important recording.
As you can see, our already have Jupyter opened into the directory for this week.
If you don't have that, please pause the video and launch Jupyter and
then come back.
And once you're back, let's create a new Jupyter notebook.
Let's go ahead and set the title, week_05, I'll name this one group by aggregate.
Then in the header information,
##CMPINF2100 Week 05,
### SPLIT-APPLY-COMBINE or
GROUPBY and AGGREAGATE (summarize).
We have learned how to summarize data in Pandas.
But we have summarized INDIVIDUAL columns,
ignoring all other columns.
Let's now explore how summary
stats of one column change or
vary across the categories of another column.
Essentially, we are going to be asking,
does the average or is the average different for a different group?
That's really what we're asking.
Let's go ahead and import the modules that we have worked with all week,
import numpy as.np, import pandas as.pd.
As with the previous recording,
we will begin with our simple example data set,
continue working with our JOINED data set,
df = pd.read_csv( 'joined_ data.csv').
Okay.
As a quick review, we know how to summarize individual columns.
For example, we know how to find out the number
of unique values per column, E has 4.
We know how to check the data type,
E is a categorical,
we know how to count the number of rows
associated with each unique value.
We also know how to calculate summary stats for
numeric columns, like B,
we can calculate its mean, or C.
But what is the AVERAGE of 'B' for
each unique value of 'E'?
How does B on average change across the categories of E?
We cannot answer this question by simply
applying the same summary methods.
We need to do something else to support our exploration, and
that something else is we need to split, apply, and then combine.
I'm using those three terms very specifically,
because split means we DIVIDE or
BREAK the data into distinct and separate groups.
We must partition the data set into the unique
categories of a **GROUPING VARIABLE**.
That means we need to know the unique
values of the grouping variable.
And for this example, I'm going to mostly focus on the E column.
We can get the unique with the unique method.
Here are all of the unique values, and the unique will also returns missing.
Split, as the name states,
we must split 'df' into smaller data sets.
Each data set will have 1 and only 1 value of the grouping variable.
So let's start with aa, the first category in alphabetical order.
I'm going to name my new data set df_E_ aa,
use the location attribute where df_E is identically equal to aa,
I need all columns, but I will force the deep copy.
Our new data set only has three rows because
aa occurred three times, and if we check,
right, E now has 1 and only 1 value.
