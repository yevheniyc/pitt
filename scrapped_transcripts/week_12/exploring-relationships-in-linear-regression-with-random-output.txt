English
The output is normally distributed around the trend.
We will call one more Gaussian
random number generator.
We need to set the residual error or remaining
variation around the trend, because remember,
the regression linear model assumes each output is
random normally distributed around its average.
So all Gaussians need a standard deviation or sigma.
And here I'm just choosing a sigma of 0.85.
We did not need to worry about sigma in our previous video when
we were focused just on how the average output or trend relates to the inputs.
So I'm setting sigma to 0.85.
Let's now add in a column Y to the DF data frame where we
call the Gaussian random number generator.
The location or average or mean is not zero,
it's equal to the trend, and the trend is intercept
plus slope times input one plus slope times input two.
The average is therefore changing as your inputs are changing.
However, the scale or standard deviation around
that trend is not changing, it's a constant.
And then the number or size of the random numbers we need
to create is equal to the number of rows in the df data frame.
Df now has the four columns, inputs one and two,
the average output or trend, as well as the random output y.
So let's now just assume this is the data set I provided to you
in a homework assignment, and I tell you you have two inputs, x1 and
x2, and one continuous output y.
Let's visualize the relationships between inputs and output.
Let's start with the relationship between x1 and y.
Now, in the previous video, when we examined these relationships,
we used line charts because we were examining how
the average output or the trend relates to the inputs.
But we will not use line charts now because
we are working with the random output
y that has unexplainable variation.
To examine the output to input relationship,
the most basic kind of relationship chart is a scatter chart.
So let's use seaborne SNs relative equals df,
x equals x1, y equals y, kind equals scatter, and then plt show.
The output y appears to be
increasing as input 1 increases.
There seems to be a positive relationship between the two.
Let's now examine the relationship between x2 and y.
The syntax is just the same, except we're going to change the x argument.
SNS relplore data equals df x equals x2,
y equals y, kind equals scatter plt show.
Now, when I look at this chart, I really can't see anything,
any kind of relationship.
There's no definite positive relationship where
the output is increasing as the input increases.
And I can't really see a definitive negative relationship.
There just kind of seems to be a random scatter.
So the relationship between the output and the second input doesn't seem to exist.
We can include linear trend lines to
help identify possible trends
between the output and the inputs.
We've used this chart before.
SNS Lm plot data equals df x equals x one,
y equals y plt show.
That straight line is the best fit line,
the regression line assuming a linear relationship
between the input and the average output.
But what's really important here is
that this line of code is only considering one input x1.
It's completely ignoring anything due to x2.
There seems to be a positive relationship between the output and
x one because of how narrow this confidence interval is.
Remember, the confidence interval
represents the uncertainty on the average output.
And when the confidence intervals do not overlap,
that means you feel confident that the average is different.
So I'm drawing boxes here around different intervals in the input,
and you're seeing the height of where we think the average could be.
And over these intervals between low, medium, and
high inputs, the confidence intervals do not overlap.
So we really feel confident that
the average is increasing as x1 increases.
Let's now make the same kind of chart
between the output and input two.
If we examine the same kind of intervals on the x axis,
now the confidence intervals all overlap.
The uncertainty on the average is overlapping.
It's therefore difficult to feel that
the average is changing as input two is changing.
But what I really want you to focus on is
just look at the best fit line itself.
This best fit line has a negative slope.
When the input x two increases, the average output is decreasing.
The syntax here, lnplot,
it's only considering this one input.
It's saying your average output or
trend is intercept plus slope times input.
But now this is input two.
If I print to the screen the slope b two.
Remember, we generated the data.
We know that the slope multiplying
input two that made the data is positive.
And yet this slope, this trend line,
has a negative slope.
So if we ignore x1, it seems like
the trend decreases as x2 increases.
