In the formula interface,
the asterisk asterisk or power operator
denotes the degree of interaction between the inputs.
Saying x1**2 is saying interact x1.
It doesn't really know what to do to interact x1.
Therefore, you cannot use
the asterisk asterisk operator
to raise an input to a power.
That's why you need to use the np.power function.
Here, I'm now fitting the model again, but my formula,
y tilde np.power (x1,
2) + np.power (x2,2).
This is now the coefficient or
the slope multiplying x1^2.
If I want to have linear and quadratic polynomials,
I need to include both in my formula,
x1 plus np.power x1 squared,
plus x2 plus np.power x2 squared.
Now we have second degree polynomials for each input.
But now, why does this matter
compared to the interactions?
A shortcut is that you can create up to and
including all degree of interactions
using the asterisk asterisk operator
in the formula interface.
Fit_i smf.ols formula, data.fit.
Again, the data is df.
But now the formula, y tilde (x1+x2)**2.
This looks like you're saying x1+x2
, that quantity squared.
Then if you go back to what high school algebra,
this is your FOIL method, x1+x2*x1+x2.
You would think you'd have to do the
first, then you have the outer,
the inner, the last.
But that's not what's happening.
This formula will not
produce quadratics or second degree polynomials.
This formula says, give me the main effects of everything
inside the parentheses and
include up to this degree of interaction.
The degree of interaction is
how many inputs are getting multiplied together.
A second degree interaction
multiplies two inputs together.
A third degree interaction
multiplies three inputs together.
Now, why is this important?
You can use this notation to create
very complex interactions between
many different types of features.
Thus, you can even interact nonlinear features together.
For our last model,
our formula will interact
the linear and the second degree polynomials
between x1 and x2.
Same data, but now the formula,
y tilde, use a parentheses,
x1 plus np.power x1 squared plus x2 plus np.power x2
squared asterisk asterisk 2 fit_j.params.
Do you see all of
these coefficients that now got estimated?
We used the same polynomials from
before but now by interacting,
we were interacting all four of these x interacting x1^2.
This is equivalent to x1^3.
X1x2,
x1 interacting with x2^2,
x1^2 interacting with x2,
x1^2 interacting with x2^2,
x2 interacting with x2^2 squared.
This is equivalent to x2^3.
You therefore need to be very
careful when you interact to
make sure you're going to produce
the kinds of features you're hoping for.
It's not really all that readable to say x1 interacting
with x1^2 when you want x1^3.
One thing that I recommend and sorry,
this is now the last model,
but when you want to interact polynomials,
I like to separate the polynomials
derived from each input using
parentheses in the formula interface.
Now fit_k smf.ols formula,
data.fit, again,
the data is df,
the formula, y tilde, ()*().
In the first parentheses x1 plus
np.power x1 squared interacting
with x1 plus np.power x2 squared.
Now, here are the main effects
of each input raised to a power x1*x2,
the interaction between the two inputs,
x1 interacting with x2^2,
x1^2 interacting with x2,
and then x1^2 interacting with x2^2.
