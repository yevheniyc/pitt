Look at the difference between
this figure and the one previously.
Now, all three have
roughly the same height on the y-axis.
This is really important.
We have removed the sample size effect.
The fact that chinstrap has
fewer data points is no longer influencing our results.
But how can we interpret this figure?
Do you remember when we first looked at
the distribution of this variable flipper length,
and we talked about how there was
one set of concentrated values,
one cluster to the left,
and one cluster to the right?
Well by conditioning on
or being given the value of a grouping variable,
grouping by species,
we have learned the right cluster
is mostly the gentoo species.
The left cluster is the combination of
the others with adelie being further to the left.
We are partitioning or separating,
segregating the different clusters
into different categories or groups.
You are set maybe your customers.
Certain customers have higher values
of a variable than others.
That's really the power of this categorical to
continuous relationship or conditional distribution plot.
What is the distribution of
a variable given the value of a categorical?
We're trying to see if those distributions
are different across the categories.
Now, the distribution that we're looking at here,
this continuous conditional distribution.
This is telling us a lot,
but it is still quite busy.
Sometimes we just want to know useful summary statistics.
For example,
is the median changing across the categories?
What is the median?
Fifty percent of the observations
are less than the median,
and 50% of the observations
are greater in value than the median.
Fifty percent of the observations are
less in value than the median,
50% of the observations are
greater in value than the median.
So if you take the penguins dataset and you describe it,
one of the summary statistics that
gets presented is the 50%,
or 50 percentile, or median.
This is the value where 50%
of the observations are less than it,
50% of the observations are greater than it.
It is another form of sensual behavior,
but it is different from the average.
For example, we can
show that this is indeed the case if we take penguins.
We pull out flipper length,
we calculate its median.
Let's now filter penguins by asking
how many observations have
the flipper length less than its median?
Let's pull out just the number of rows.
Let me just copy that,
paste it in and divide by the total number of rows.
It's just under 50%.
We do less than or equal.
Now we hit right just a little over 50%.
The point of this here is
this median point is really trying to
divide our data set into half of it is to the left,
half of it is to the right.
There is another form of central behavior.
We can easily visualize how
the median changes across categories via a box plot.
