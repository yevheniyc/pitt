The point plot is a specialty figure
in seaborne focused on comparing
average averages across groups.
It comes from cath block because the goal is to examine a categorical variable.
It starts with a data set.
The x variable is intended to be the categorical, such as species.
The y variable is intended to be the continuous variable.
Flipper length, millimeters, kind equals a point plot.
Now, by default, a line segment is included to connect the dots.
The dots are the averages per category.
But in this case, I don't want to connect the dots.
I specify the argument join equals false.
By default, the plus or
minus 2 standard error interval, or
95% confidence interval is included.
That's that vertical line around the dot.
This figure is therefore allowing us to examine
what is the uncertainty on the average based on the sample size.
The smaller the sample size, the greater the uncertainty,
the larger the standard error interval.
The purpose of this figure is if the confidence intervals do not overlap,
that means we feel confident the average is different across groups.
So I feel confident chinstrap is lower on average than gen two.
I feel confident that adelie is lower on average than chinstrap.
Remember earlier in the semester when we were generating all those random
observations, calculating the average and
calculating the standard error on the average?
That's what this interval is.
This interval is representing the amount of variability on the average or
really the uncertainty on the average.
But you don't have to go through and do all those calculations.
The point plot does it for you.
So again, what we've just examined here is we have seen
three different ways to study if a categorical variable is
associated with changes in a continuous variable.
We looked at the conditional KDE plot we are looking for
if the distribution itself changes,
whether how it's located, its shape or its width.
And look closely here.
Remember how I mentioned the density?
The maximum density is roughly the same.
Well, if the density is lower, the variability will be higher.
Look at the box plot.
The box plot reveals all three categories have roughly the same box size,
the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile.
But this is called the interquartile range.
It's another way of saying the variability.
It's roughly the same.
You see the whiskers?
These extend out to the largest extreme values, or
really the range, the min to max.
We'll talk about these dots later.
But the min to max, the range is roughly the same across the categories.
So the variation is the same basically across the categories.
That's why the these densities are roughly the same.
The max densities are the same, roughly the same,
even though we have different sample sizes.
That's why it's so important to set common norm to false.
So again, conditional distribution plot.
Look at the shape.
See if the distribution changes.
Summarize the conditional distributions.
Look at just the summary stats per group.
A streamlined figure.
You can include the averages, but if you're going to include the averages, it's
actually best to examine the uncertainty on the average through the point block.
