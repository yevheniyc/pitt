The pairs plot not only tells you
the relationship between each pair of variables.
It lets you know how
each variable is distributed by itself.
This can be really helpful, for example,
when we are looking at clusters.
You see this one set of grouping,
it's associated with this group.
Then do you see this other concentrated interval?
It's associated with the other group.
Now, let me zoom back in.
We can group or condition on categorical variables
within pairs plots just
like we did with scatter plots and trend plots.
We can color by
a categorical variable via the hue argument.
With the relplot,
remember how we could take penguins and
for a particular pair of continuous variables,
we could use hue to distinguish the species.
We could do the same thing with lmplot.
To help us understand how
the relationship changes based on groups,
we can color pairs plots via hue as well.
The syntax is very similar,
sns.pairplot(data = penguins,
hue = 'species'), plt.show().
We get the same set of subplots showing us
the pair wise relationship
between each pair of continuous variables.
But now we are coloring by a categorical.
The main diagonal is now
the conditional KDE plot so that way we can
see how does the distribution of
one continuous variable relate to the categorical?
I should note here,
let me zoom out again,
by default, pairs plot only shows you the numerics,
and you don't have to say numeric only.
Notice species is not shown in here by default.
We can assign species to hue
because penguin still has species in it,
that column, even though it was not shown before.
However, the above pairs plot is wrong.
Look closely at the conditional KDEs
along the main diagonal.
Do you see the orange,
how the orange KDE,
the orange density plot is shorter than
the blue and the green in every
single main diagonal marginal?
Look at the counts for the species.
sns.catplot(data = penguins,
x = 'species', kind = 'count'.
Chinstrap has the smallest sample size.
The default pairs plot in seaborn is wrong because
the conditional KDE shown along
the main diagonal is fooled by the sample size.
We need to remove the sample size effect
by setting the common_norm to FALSE.
The exact same problem
that occurs in the conditional KDE,
this is the same problem in the conditional KDE chart.
Let's go back to it.
sns.displot(data = penguins,
x = 'flipper_length_millimeters',
kind = 'kde'), plt.show.
This is the marginal,
The marginal KDE is shown below for one variable.
Now, the conditional KDE
is shown with the wrong settings.
The default settings, (data = penguins,
x = 'flipper_length_millimeters',
kind = 'kde', hue = species.
You see how the orange KDE is the shortest one here?
That's only because the orange bar
for chinstrap has the smallest sample size.
Remove the sample size effect with common_norm=False.
sns.displot(data = penguins,
x = 'flipper_length_millimeters',
kind = 'kde', hue = 'species', common_norm=False.
