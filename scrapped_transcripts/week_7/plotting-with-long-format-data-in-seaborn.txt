To be very precise,
we can even identify the columns
to gather via the value_vars argument.
This is the most precise way to set this up.
Penguins, reset the index,
rename the columns index.
To rowid melt id_vars is id_cols,
value_vars to penguins_features.columns.
We're saying what not to gather and what to gather.
Let's assign this to a new object.
Now I'll just copy this and assign it to penguins_lf.
Plotting with long format.
We can now associate the variable column
with facets in seaborn.
Seaborn, I mentioned earlier,
wants long format data.
It wants to have a column in
your data frame to associate to everything in the plot,
such as the column or row facets.
This is why we needed to do the reshaping.
The variable column are
now what we want to put in each subplot.
Let's call the sns.displot function again.
But this time with
the long format data and
assigning the call argument to variable.
Sns.displot data = penguins_lf,
x equals, what do I want to
now associate for distribution?
I want to study value.
But we're not just going to plot value as it is.
Every single variable or facet.
Every single facet or subplot must be a variable.
We get each facet correct,
but it still doesn't look right.
It actually looks like what we had originally.
The reason is because by default,
the y axis and the x axis have the same scales.
We need to force free or not sharing x and y axis scales.
So sns.displot data = penguins_lf x = value.
Col = variable, kind = hist.
Greater control in displot comes from
the fact_kws or facet keywords argument.
It's here where through a dictionary,
we can specify sharex: false, sharey: false.
We're on the right track because I can see
what's going on now in the right motes facet,
but things still aren't working.
We have one more change.
By default, the histograms,
want to use the common bins in all facets.
We don't want or need that.
In addition to specifying the facet keywords,
we need one more argument.
Let's do this one more time.
Penguins_lf x = value,
col = variable.
Kind = hist.
Facet keywords, sharex: false, sharey: false.
The last argument we need common bins = false.
We do not want common bins.
Now we have the marginal histogram
for each variable in its own facet.
We can do the same thing with KD plots.
But remember, common norm must be false.
So sns.discplot data = penguins_lf,
x = value, col = variable,
kind = KDE, facet keywords as a dictionary,
sharex: false, sharey: false.
But instead of common bins,
it's common norm = false.
